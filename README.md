**From Charts to Hearts: using Data Science to Boost mrld's Spotify Presence**

In the realm of music, Spotify streams hold immense significance, serving as a key metric to gauge song reception. Securing a spot in the top 200 chart signifies not just accomplishment but also provides valuable insights into current trends, guiding artists and record labels towards what resonates with the audience.

The dataset considered encompasses the Philippines' daily top 200 songs, spanning from 2017 to the third quarter of 2023. The primary objective is to formulate effective strategies for a specific artist to elevate their overall ranking on the chart. These insights and recommendations will be presented in a pitch to the record label managing the chosen artist.

In the pursuit of developing effective strategies to enhance the music careers of Filipino artists, the initial step involved meticulous artist selection. Meriel de Jesus, more recognized for her mononym, mrld, emerged as the ideal candidate poised to benefit the most from this study. A two-fold strategy was devised. Firstly, insights were sought from higher-ranking artists by delving into their marketing tactics and release timing strategies; also, thorough analysis of audio features like loudness, speechiness, and acousticness was conducted to provide a nuanced understanding of prevailing trends. Secondly, the creation of a recommender engine.

Given Spotify's absence of specific genre classifications, playlist names were adopted as crowdsourced genre labels. The extraction of playlists from Spotify via the API became imperative. This process entailed subjective keyword selection, where relevant genre labels considered included OPM Rock, OPM Rap, OPM P-Pop, and OPM Senti. The credibility of playlists was gauged based on their follower count; playlists considered were only those that exceeded the 100,000 threshold. Machine learning models were trained on a dataset containing tracks from the aforementioned playlists for genre classification based on audio features. The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the best model with 77% accuracy. It was then applied to the original dataset, effectively appending tracks with a genre label. Finally, the creation of a recommender engine pool centered around a seed trackâ€”Ligaya, mrld's most-streamed song.

In conclusion, these recommendations encompass a holistic approach, considering both marketing and musical aspects. First, the strategic scattering of mrld's events, ranging from concerts to TikTok engagement, is a potent strategy to counteract potential dips in streams, thereby extending the longevity of her songs on the chart. Second, releasing songs during a relatively quiet season for top artists maximizes impact as there is less competition. Furthermore, a nuanced adjustment of audio features, including decreasing loudness, speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness, aligns with the characteristics of top Pinoy songs, potentially contributing to heightened resonance among the audience. Lastly, collaboration with artists such as December Avenue, Join the Club, or Belle Mariano represents a promising opportunity. While this might pose challenges, curating playlists featuring these artists is an immediate alternative, observing whether mrld's songs gain traction through association. It's crucial to note, however, that exploring other songs as seed tracks may yield different suggestions.
